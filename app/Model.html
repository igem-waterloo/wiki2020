					Our modelling work falls into two very different but complementary categories: process design and protein design. For protein design, we used protein modelling and molecular dynamics software to evaluate our rationally-designed copper-binding protein candidates. For process design, we use partial differential equation models to better understand our packed column reactor and optimise its design.

					PROTEIN DESIGN
				</div>
				
				<div class='info'>
					<p>Several distinct modelling approaches were used as part of our rational protein design.</p>
					<h1>Rosetta</h1>
					<h2>Introduction to Rosetta</h2>
					<p>To analyze the proposed design changes from the rational design process, software tools were used to provide initial analysis and modelling of the structure. Among various computational protein design platforms, Rosetta was chosen for redesigning the structure and conducting energy analyses. The Rosetta software suite offers algorithms and protocols for macromolecular structure prediction and analysis of protein structures (Leaver-Fay et al., 2011). As a unified software package, it provides a wide range of tools suited for the project: to redesign the protein structure that has an increased binding affinity for Cu<sup>2+</sup> (Kaufmann, Lemmon, DeLuca, Sheehan & Meiler, 2010). </p>
					<p>Within the Rosetta software suite, the tasks and operations within the libraries are combined as algorithms called <b>protocols</b>. Some of protocols’ major functionalities include protein structure prediction, protein docking, protein design and energy scoring analysis. In this project, the structure of the original protein is known, therefore only energy scoring functions and the protein design protocols are used to assess how the residue-specific mutations increase stability and binding affinity (Leaver-Fay et al., 2011). Some specific functions such as Relax, a protocol for simple all-atom refinement of input structure, and Point Mutant Scan Application, a protocol for mutating the protein structure at specific residues and analyzing its stability, are used in the rational design process ("Applications for Macromolecule Design", 2020). </p>
					<h2>Protein Mutation Procedure</h2>
					<p>Using the Rosetta official documentation and the <a href="http://2016.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b6/TUE_Rosetta_beginners_guide.pdf">Rosetta Guide for the iGEM beginner</a> made by Team iGEM Technion and iGEM TU Eindhoven 2016, a structure analysis procedure was developed. The protocols mentioned in the following steps are written in a shell script. </p>
					<ol>
						<li>Obtain the original Protein Data Bank (PDB) file of the Mst-CopC structure. (It is accessible from RCSB PDB.)</li>
						<li>
							Prepare the structure.
							<ol>
								<li>Clean the PDB file while keeping the ligand. (This removes the information in PDB that Rosetta doesn’t use. (&quot;How to prepare structures for use in Rosetta&quot;, 2020))</li>
								<li>Run Relax protocol. (This reduces minor steric clashes in the protein-ligand complex. Running this protocol ensures the structure is at its most stable form before making mutations (&quot;Relax application&quot;, 2020). ) </li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>Point mutant scan application. (Though the algorithm can scan for point mutants for given residues and determine the change in Gibbs free energy a mutation causes, a mutant file can be used to specify the mutants on specific residues determined in the rational design phase. )</li>
						<li>Energy scoring analysis for the overall structure and residue-specific energy breakdown. (Residue specific energy and overall energy information will be produced as outputs along with mutated PDB files in step 3. ) </li>
					</ol>
					<p>At step 2.2 Relax and step 3 Point Mutation, relaxed and mutated protein structures will be produced as PDB files along with the energy score of each output. The scoring function in Rosetta is an optimized energy function that calculates the energy of all atomic interactions in a globular protein (&quot;Scoring Tutorial&quot;, 2020). The score is a weighted sum of energy terms, including some representing physical forces like electrostatics and Van der Waal’s interactions and others statistical terms that indicate if the protein structure looks like any known structures (&quot;Scoring Tutorial&quot;, 2020). A complete list of energy terms and weights used in the scoring function can be found on the <a href="https://www.rosettacommons.org/demos/latest/tutorials/scoring/scoring">Rosetta Scoring Tutorial Documentation</a>. Therefore, instead of presenting the scores in physical energy units like kcal/mol, a custom Rosetta Energy Units (REU) is used due to the presence of the statistical terms. This score allows us to compare stability between scored structures. The lower the score, the more stable a structure is, which is sufficient to evaluate the relative stability of the mutated CopC-Cu<sup>2+</sup> candidates. </p>
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<h3>Single Residue Mutation</h3>
					<p>The table below shows the overall energy scores in REU and energy term breakdown for all protein candidates mutated on a single residue. The first column of the table indicates the mutation applied to the structure: 5icu is the PDB ID for Mst-CopC, and mutation code <original amino acid><residue number><new amino acid> follows the ID. </p>
					<p>As seen below, the original score of the protein is -320.377. The mutated proteins are sorted in ascending total scores, meaning that they are ordered in decreasing stability. Among all candidates, only the mutation from histidine to aspartic acid at residue 85 (H85D) produced a lower energy score than the original structure. However, most candidate’s scores are between -320 to -290, which means most candidates are relatively stable after mutation and molecular dynamic analysis can be done to further analyze the candidates. </p>

					<p>These PDB files also contain per-residue energy scores, which can be used to compare the effect each mutation has on each residue. We assembled these scores into heatmaps, where each row corresponds to either a mutation or the original protein, and each column corresponds to a certain residue. This data was difficult to visualize effectively due to the presence of outliers, so certain data transformations were applied to better analyze some aspect of our energy score results. (The heatmap can be found in our github as heatmap_single_relative.png.)</p>		
					<img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/8/8c/T--Waterloo--heatmap-single-relative.png" alt="Figure 1. Heat map with unmutated protein energy scores subtracted.">
					<div class="caption">Figure 1. Heat map with unmutated protein energy scores subtracted. </div>
					<p>One such transformation is the above heatmap, which has subtracted the unmutated proteins energy scores from each mutant (and itself). The resulting scores are therefore relative to the unmutated protein, and show increases or decreases in score, aiding one in finding whether a mutation is beneficial to the energy score of each residue.</p>
					<img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/e/e1/T--Waterloo--heatmap-single-scaled.png" alt="Figure 2. Heat map with each column scaled to itself.">
					<div class="caption">Figure 2. Heat map with each column scaled to itself.</div>
					<p>Seen above is another heatmap, except that each column has been scaled to the range [0, 1], highlighting changes in energy score. Unlike the previous heatmap, it does not indicate the scale of these changes.</p>
					<p>Note that in both heatmaps the rows and columns have the same labels, and represent the same things, only the values contained within the map itself have been modified. </p>
					<p>Using these heatmaps, it is possible to rationally select mutations to simultaneously apply in order to further reduce the overall energy scores. Possible next steps include applying a logarithmic scale to better differentiate between the values in the heatmap.</p>
					<h3>Double Residue Mutations</h3>
					<p>To determine a suitable combination of two mutations, it is computationally feasible to simply run all possible pairs of mutations from our set of rationally selected single mutations. The overall energy scores of each of these “double mutants” was also assembled into a heatmap, as an efficient method of comparing all of these mutants at once.</p>

					<div class="caption">Figure 3. Heat map of double residue mutations.</div>
					<p>Each row and column respond to a particular mutation, with each intersection representing both mutations applied together. The symmetry appears to be inexact, a phenomenon which was likely due to how Rosetta applies multiple mutations.</p>
					<p>Based on the results from Rosetta and analyzing heatmaps, a list of optimal candidates is compiled. These mutated candidates will be further assessed using more detailed molecular dynamic analysis. </p>

					<h1>Molecular Dynamics</h1>
					<p>Molecular dynamics was used to test the relative binding affinities of these candidate proteins. We used GROMACS (Berendsen et al., 1999) along with the Charmm36 (Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010) force field parameters which include parameters for copper ions in solution. This allows us to estimate the total interaction energy between the copper ion and the protein, and using the relative magnitudes of these interaction energies allows us to compare the strength of binding. Molecular dynamics provides a more rigorous method for comparing binding strength due to the fact that a molecular dynamics simulation takes into account the motion of every individual atom in the system and their interactions.</p>
					<p>All GROMACS simulations were run on the Graham computing cluster located at the University of Waterloo and hosted by ComputeCanada.</p>
					<p>In order to implement a molecular mechanics simulation, the protein pdb files were converted to the gromacs format using Charmm-GUI, an online tool developed in order to construct topology files and parameter files for proteins using the Charmm force field. Once the required files were attained, the system was placed in solution in a process known as solvation, and the charge in the system was balanced by introducing faraway sodium or chloride ions. The system then undergoes an energy minimization process in which the protein and copper ion are restrained while the solvent molecules settle into place. This avoids extreme behaviour that could occur due to collisions between molecules. The thermodynamics of the system is then set up using standard NVT and NPT equilibration procedures in GROMACS, and then the final simulation is run. </p>
					<p>A typical ten nanosecond simulation was performed for each candidate protein. The results are found in the table below.</p>

					PROCESS DESIGN

				<div class='info'>
					<h1>Motivation For Our Treatment Process</h1>
					<p>Our metal-removal technology will compete with a variety of other aqueous metal waste treatment processes. Some current methods for treating aqueous metal wastes include chemical precipitation, ion exchange, adsorption, and membrane filtration (Fu et al., 2011). Chemical precipitation is particularly widespread because of its relatively simplicity and low cost (Fu et al., 2011). In this method, the pH of the metal waste is increased by the addition of a base such as lime, causing the metal ions to precipitate as insoluble hydroxides that can be recovered as solid sludge. However, removing water from this sludge can be costly, and the resulting sludge is typically disposed of, so valuable metals cannot be recovered or reused. Ion exchange, membrane filtration, and membrane filtration are all relatively new technologies (Fu et al., 2011), so high costs often prohibit large scale applications. Furthermore, there are few established methods that recover metal ions from industrial wastewaters to allow recycling. We therefore aim to fill in this gap in metal waste treatment by using metal binding proteins to create a novel metal removal and recovery process. This process should quickly, selectively, and cheaply remove metal ions from wastewater, allowing metal ions to be recovered and recycled, providing economic and environmental benefits. </p>
					<p>In order for our designed metal and cellulose binding fusion protein to have merit in the real world, it is imperative to design a suitable industrial process that can use our biotechnology to treat metal waste. </p>
					<p>We will design a reactor to treat copper-containing metal finishing waste, at a scale relevant for a typical semiconductor manufacturing plant. Metal finishing wastes result from processes including electroplating, in which dissolved metals (copper, in this case) are deposited in thin layers onto solid surfaces using electrochemical reactions (Arán, 2017). After the process is complete, the remaining solutions must be treated before disposal. However, since dissolved metal wastes are produced by a large variety of industrial processes, the design and modelling process applied here could be used for any other waste stream and dissolve metal(s). </p>
					<h1>Choosing Our Reactor Type</h1>
					<p>In order to effectively treat large volumes of aqueous waste, we immobilised our cellulose and metal binding fusion protein inside an industrial bioreactor. Some advantages granted by using a bioreactor include: reactor size control and dimension tunability, continuous operation, and a wide variety of sub-types of reactors to base our design off of (Shuler &amp; Kargi, 2002). Furthermore, the bioreactors have long been used for industrial scale processes that operate based on enzymatic or cellular function, so research in this area is well developed. </p>
					<p>Of the many varieties of bioreactors available, we chose to use a packed column reactor. A packed column reactor consists of a large container filled with some sort of porous packing material, and effluent is fed through the bed, allowing a reactor to occur (Shuler &amp; Kargi 2002). For our reactor, we will use cellulose beads as a packing material. Packed column reactors enable large volumes of waste to be treated in a continuous manner, providing much greater efficiency than batch processes that treat a fixed volume of waste at one time (Shuler &amp; Kargi 2002). For our metal removal application, all removed metal will stay trapped inside the column as waste is fed through. Thus, the metal can be removed at a convenient time, such as during off-peak waste production hours.</p>
					<p>Since our fusion proteins include a cellulose binding domain that binds cellulose very strongly, the fusion proteins can be immobilised on the cellulose packing by simply feeding them into the column. By immobilising our fusion proteins on the surface of the cellulose packing, we are able to maximize the surface area of reactive sites, thus increasing the treatment rate of the wastewater system. </p>
					<p>With this general design in mind, we set out to use engineering and modelling tools to decide how to build a suitable reactor to treat our waste stream of interest.</p>
					<p>We envision that our reactor will operate in two stages: </p>
					<ol>
						<li>First, the metal containing wastewater will be flowed through the reactor, allowing the metal in the wastewater to bind to the proteins within. This will produce a stream of clean water that can be discharged to the environment. This is the <b>“binding”</b> stage.</li>
						<li>Secondly, once the reactor is saturated with metal, we will rinse the reactor with another solution of a different pH, which will cause the metal ions to unbind from the reactor. This will result in a concentrated and pure solution of dissolved metal. This resulting solution could then be recycled for various applications. This is the <b>“elution”</b> stage.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Below is a 3D model that provides an example of our reactor’s general construction. Wastewater will be pumped into the reactor from the bottom, passing through the cellulose packing before exiting through the top of the reactor. </p>
					<img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/a/a0/T--Waterloo--Reactor_Column_Design.jpeg" alt="3D Model of our reactor design">
					<div class="caption">Figure 5. 3D model of our packed column reactor created using CAD.</div>
					<h1>Developing Equations For Modelling</h1>
					<p>In order to model a system undergoing chemical reactions, we must first develop a kinetic rate law for the reactions. For our system, we will use a straightforward dimensional analysis approach similar to the Langmuir isotherm. This is a commonly applied model for adsorption of a reactant onto a protein. </p>
					<p>To determine the net rate of adsorption of Cu<sup>2+</sup> onto CopC, we add the forward binding rate to the reverse binding rate. A key nuance of this model is that the concentration of CopC is given as a surface concentration. In order to relate the surface concentration to the rate of change of a volumetric concentration, a conversion factor is computed by considering the surface area per volume of BMCC cellulose that the protein is attached to.</p>
					<p>Suppose the surface area per volume of BMCC is given by a parameter $$ a $$ and that the fraction of the reactor occupied by cellulose is $$ f $$. Let $$ m = [Cu<sup>2+</sup>] $$, let $$ Q $$ be the initial protein surface concentration, and let $$ q = Q - [CopC] $$. </p>
					<p>Free protein + Free metal $$ \underset{k_d}{\stackrel{k_a}{\rightleftharpoons}} $$ </p>
					<p>Protein-metal complex $$ k_a $$: adsorption rate constant, $$ k_d $$: desorption rate constant</p>
					<p>Adsorption (forward) rate:</p>
					<p>$$ v_a = k_a  m  N $$</p>
					<p>Where $$ N = (Q - q) $$ So, $$ v_a = k_a m (Q - q) $$</p>
					<p>Desorption (reverse) rate:</p>
					<p>$$ v_d = k_d q $$</p>
					<p>Variables:
					$$ v $$: rate ($$ \frac{mol}{m^2  s} $$)
					$$ m $$: free metal concentration ($$ \frac{mol}{L} $$)
					$$ k_a $$: adsorption rate constant ($$ \frac{L}{mol s} $$)
					$$ k_d $$: desorption rate constant ($$ \frac{1}{s} $$)
					$$ N $$: free sites ($$ \frac{mol}{m s} $$)
					$$ Q $$: total sites ($$ \frac{mol}{m s} $$)
					$$ q $$: occupied sites ($$ \frac{mol}{m s} $$)</p>
