					We outlined the safety precautions we would have taken to complete our member training and project if we were able to access the lab this year. Although we were unable to perform any experiments, we still considered safety when writing our suggested procedures. We also state our lab’s safety equipment and the university and national guidelines we must follow while working in it.

					PROJECT
				</div>
				
				<div class='info'>
					<p>While the team unfortunately did not have access to the lab beyond completing training in late February, the following design considerations were proposed for wet-lab work on the project:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>We have chosen non-pathogenic chassis which are described as Biosafety Level 1 organisms (<i>E. coli</i> DH5alpha, and <i>E. coli</i> BL21 (DE3)).</li>
						<li>The primary material to be used in our prototype is cellulose, which poses a risk only when large amounts are ingested or when dust enters the eyes and causes mechanical irritation. Of course, no lab materials are ingested, and to limit eye irritation, cellulose will be dissolved in solution prior to use and goggles will be worn when weighing the dry powder. </li>
						<li>The metals to be tested are iron and copper. These also present few adverse health effects when not ingested, inhaled or in contact with eyes or skin. To mitigate these risks, gloves and goggles will be worn and the metals will be used in solutions prepared in the fume hood. Lastly, since the metals pose a threat to aquatic life, the waste will be collected and disposed of at the University’s hazardous waste disposal centre.</li>
						<li>We also decided against targeting certain metals with our system because of their toxicity (ex. arsenic).  While this means the reward for removal of these heavy metals from wastewater is large, it would pose a greater risk to lab members. Metals that are safer to work with, such as copper and iron, would still demonstrate that our general design could be useful in targeted metal clean-up.</li>
					</ul>

					LAB
				</div>

				<div class='info'>
					<p>Our lab is located on the third floor of the ESC (Earth Science and Chemistry) building at the University of Waterloo. We have our own tabletop centrifuges, thermal cycler, analytical and top-loading balances, -20°C freezer, and 4°C refrigerator. We share the -80°C freezer and 37°C incubator with the host lab, under the guidance and supervision of Vivian Cheung at the Science Innovation Hub.</p>

					GUIDELINES
				</div>
				
				<div class='info'>
					<h1>Canada</h1>
					<p>In Canada, all research practices involving biological materials are strictly regulated by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health.html">Public Health Agency of Canada</a>. In addition, there are certain regulations that must be followed in every work place, as recorded by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/health-safety/reports/workplace-health-safety-facts.html">Workplace Health &amp; Safety Regulations</a>.</p>
					<h1>University</h1>
					<p>All laboratory practices operated within the University of Waterloo iGEM Team are regulated by the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/">University of Waterloo’s Safety Office</a>. As such, everyone in the lab had been appropriately trained with the safety modules required by the University of Waterloo before they were permitted to work in the lab. The training included WHMIS 2015, Laboratory Biosafety Training, and General Lab Safety. The training was based on the following safety guidelines:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/laboratory-safety">University of Waterloo Laboratory Safety Guidelines</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/laboratory-safety/biosafety">University of Waterloo Biological Safety Guidelines</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/occupational-health-safety/whmis">University of Waterloo Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System</a> </li>
						<li><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/occupational-health-safety/workplace-violence-and-harassment">University of Waterloo Workplace Violence and Harassment</a> </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Furthermore, location-specific training was provided by Vivian Cheung for working in the Science Innovation Hub. This included mandatory donning of lab goggles, coats, and gloves whenever in the space.</p>
					<p>Lastly, all protocols conducted by the Waterloo iGEM team at the University of Waterloo are described in Safe Operating Procedures (SOPs) approved by advisors in the Science Innovation Hub.</p>
					<h1>Team</h1>
					<p>All of our chemical solutions are labelled and safely stored in appropriate containers. Flammable substances and acids are stored separately in appropriate cupboards. From our broken glass waste bin and regularly checked fire extinguisher, to our fully stocked first aid kit and highly visible safety information signs on the door, we take safety awareness and procedures seriously. We also dispose of our biohazardous waste properly -- materials such as contaminated pipette tips, microtubes, KimWipes, etc. are put in biohazardous waste containers and compiled into our large bin. Once the bin is full, we safely transport it to the hazardous waste disposal site on the university campus, where it is properly disposed of by qualified employees. We have also implemented a weekly eyewash maintenance program to ensure that stagnant, dead-leg water is removed from the tubing and that the apparatus is always clear and properly functional in the case of an emergency. Overall, our lab and project have many safety features implemented to ensure everyone involved inside and outside of the lab are kept safe.</p>
