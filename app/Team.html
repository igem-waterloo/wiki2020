						<strong> What's your biggest life goal? </strong> <br><br>
						Oh there's no character limit on this? Sweet. You ever just dream of settling down and having a little family in a cozy home and maybe every now and then you'll cruise down an open country road with the sunset sky on fire all around you, or chill in a field with your special someone as you watch the night sky twinkle and talk about how we're spinning furiously through space on a tiny big rock and nothing matters in the end but everything matters in the moment?

						<strong> Fun fact about yourself? </strong> <br><br>
						A fun fact about me is that I can wiggle my ears! Although... most of you will never get to witness that under my hijab but hey, at least you know it's true. <br> <br>
						<strong> What's your biggest life goal? </strong> <br><br>
						My biggest goal in life is to live my life in happiness and positivity, and to find little ways to share those sentiments with other people.

						I traveled to France in 2017 for the 100th anniversary of Vimy Ridge. <br> <br>

						<strong> If you could have one superpower to improve our 2020 iGEM project, what would it be and why?  </strong> <br><br>

						<strong> What's your biggest life goal? </strong> <br><br>
						My biggest life goal is to work with kids and families that are going through the same things as mine; I have a sibling who's been sick for a decade and a half. That's a long time, and it's tough on everyone involved, so I really want to be in a position of providing support, hope, and reassurance to them! <br> <br>
						<strong> If you were to be a lab equipment, what would you be and why?  </strong> <br><br>
						I would be an Erlenmeyer flask because there's fun stuff inside, endless possibilities of what experiment you could be doing, AND you get to hold the sauce :) What more could a gal want?

					<div class="col teaminfo">
						<strong> Fun fact about yourself? </strong> <br><br>
						I once ran into Nobel laureate Donna Strickland in the hallway of the physics building while I was wearing a tutu, a bucket hat and a pink feather boa.  <br> <br>
						<strong> If you could have one superpower to improve our 2020 iGEM project, what would it be and why?  </strong> <br><br>
						My ideal superpower would be creating proteins that don't die in highly acidic conditions... that would have saved us all quite a few headaches :)

						<strong> Fun fact about yourself? </strong> <br><br>
						Clare R. and I share a single brain cell but we rock the HECK out of it. When we form complete and coherent sentences together... beware.  <br> <br>
						<strong> If you could have one superpower to improve our 2020 iGEM project, what would it be and why? </strong> <br><br>
						Probably mind control, which sounds very villainy, but I'd simply have all of the stakeholders we've reached out to reply to our emails! That, or whatever superpower allows me to make our system indestructible, so we don't have to change industries... again.

						<strong> What's your biggest life goal? </strong> <br><br>
						Living. <br> <br>
						<strong> If you could have one superpower to improve our 2020 iGEM project, what would it be and why?  </strong> <br><br>
						Not needing to sleep - it's pretty self-explanatory.

						<strong> If you were to be a lab equipment, what would you be and why? </strong> <br><br>
						I'd be someone's lunch, because I have no business being in a lab. <br> <br>
						<strong> If you could have one superpower to improve our 2020 iGEM project, what would it be and why?  </strong> <br><br>
						Stop time so I have more time to work.

						<strong> Fun fact about yourself? </strong> <br><br>
						I love violin, whitewater kayaking, and crafting <br> <br>
						<strong> If you could have one superpower to improve our 2020 iGEM project, what would it be and why?  </strong> <br><br>
						If my brain were a supercomputer, it would be a lot more efficient to process equations and models!

					<div class="col teaminfo">
						<strong> What's your biggest life goal?</strong> <br><br>
						To create a standard, streamlined procedure for drug development against any disease using a mix of computer technology and biochemical theories! Or, more realistically, find a lab where I can both write code and do experiments. :) <br> <br>
						<strong> If you were to be a lab equipment, what would you be and why?  </strong> <br><br>
						A rotary evaporator. Seemingly unremarkable, or at least not as flashy as the larger apparatus, but fast and efficient at its job.

						Outside of school, I am an avid musician and enjoy learning new instruments. <br> <br>

						Imagine if we had the power to travel to a different dimension (ideally one without COVID-19)? Then we could have gotten experimental data in the lab to determine binding constants. That would have been nice.
