				<p>Initially inspired by the ominous appearance of heavy metal contaminated mine tailings ponds, Waterloo iGEM hoped to design a biological system that could remove heavy metal ions from the polluted water. However, as our proposed design required a control flow of water in addition to other chemical and physical requirements, we shifted our problem space to the electronics industry. </p>
				<p>The exponential growth displayed by the electronics industry is adored by consumers, as it increases the amount of available products in the market! However, as production increases, the volume of heavy metal contaminated wastewater generated by this industry has deleterious consequences to the environment, ecosystems and human health. </p>
				<p class="introduce">Inspired by this space, we introduce REMINE.</p>
				<p>REMINE is a packed column bioreactor containing metal-binding proteins which remove and recover toxic but valuable heavy metals from electronic manufacturing wastewater. The REMINE system is highly modular and can be customized for specific metals, industries, and local regulations. We have used protein modelling and molecular dynamics to improve our proteinsâ€™ metal affinity and process engineering tools to design an efficient large-scale bioreactor. With REMINE, the electronic industry can continue to grow while reducing its impact on our environment and health.</p>
